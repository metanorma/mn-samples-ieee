== Important elements of IEEE standards drafts

=== General

IEEE drafts should be created using one of the approved IEEE SA templates.
The templates have built-in macro features that allow for easy tagging
of each of the draft elements.footnote:[IEEE SA approved templates
can be found online at
https://standards.ieee.org/develop/drafting-standard/resources.html.]

Sources listed in the normative references clause shall also be cited
in text. Explain the role and significance of each normative reference.
Note that IEEE drafts may be included in the normative references
clause as long as they are properly cited. See reference to IEEE P802.21
(Draft 14, November 2003) in Clause 2 of this sample.

NOTE: A normative reference is a document that users of the standard
need to have on hand and understand in order to correctly implement
the material contained in an IEEE draft.

NOTE: Documents that serve as supplemental information that authors
of the standard found useful when researching the material, but that
do not carry the same weight as the normative references, are usually
informative and therefore would belong in a bibliography (informative
annex).

All IEEE standards shall use metric units as the primary units of
measure. Customary equivalents may be included in the text after the
metric units in parentheses. In the case of tables, separate tables
for metric and customary units may be included. See National Electrical
Safety Code^(R)^ (NESC^(R)^) (Accredited Standards Committee C2-2012)
and National Electrical Code^(R)^ (NEC^(R)^) (NFPA 70, 2011 Edition)
for examples. For more information on the use of metric in IEEE standards,
see IEEE/ANSI SI 10. For guidance on the use of letter symbols for
units of measurement, refer to IEEE Std 260.1-2004.


=== Lists

Lists in a clause or subclause may be ordered or unordered.

The following is an example of a properly formatted ordered list:

. Name of the manufacturer
. Connection chart showing
.. Full winding development
.. Taps
. Self-impedance (for linear coupler transformers)
.. Reactance
.. Impedance
... For volts
... For amperes

The following is an example of a properly formatted unordered list:

* Begin with a capital letter.
* Include final punctuation for all items in the list if one item
in the list is a complete sentence.


=== Tables

Tables should be cited in text and the significance of the tables
explained. Table titles are positioned above the tables. <<table_1>>
shows the nomenclature of a properly formatted table.

[[table_1]]
.Table formatting
[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
.2+^.^h| Column heading .2+^.^h| Column heading 2+^.^h| Column heading
footnote:[Table footnotes are considered to be a normative part of
the document.]
^.^h| Column heading ^.^h| Column heading

| Line heading

| Line heading

|===

NOTE: This table is provided as an example. The structure of actual
tables may vary depending on the data being
displayed.

NOTE: Use 0.75 Xd for hydrogenerators without amortisseur windings.


Column headings are in bold and centered. If a table extends beyond
one page, carry the title of the table over to each subsequent page
with "`(_continued_)`" after the title. Table notes are informative;
table footnotes are normative.

The following is an example of an informal table. Note that there
is no title or table number. Use these sparingly. It is preferred
that all tables are numbered and titled.

[cols="<,^",options="unnumbered,header"]
|===
^| Cable type ^| Rated voltage (kV)
a| High pressure | 69&ndash;161
a| Low pressure

Gas-filled
a| 10&ndash;29

30&ndash;46
a|Low and medium pressure

Liquid-filled
a| 15&ndash;161

=== Figures

Figures should be cited in text and the significance of the figures
explained. Figure titles are positioned below the figures themselves.
Figures can be created using text or graphics software. <<fig1>> and
<<fig2>> show properly formatted figures.

NOTE: Notes to figures are formatted between the graphic and the figure
caption.

=== Equations

Equations should be cited in text and the significance of each equation
explained. The equation number should be right-aligned. See <<eq1>>.

[[eq1]]
[stem]
++++
Y(x) = Y_0 exp[-(x - x_0)^2 // (2f^2) ]
++++

where

stem:[Y(x)]:: is the amplitude of the Gaussian function at channel stem:[x]
stem:[Y_0]:: is the height of the Gaussian at the centroid channel
stem:[x]:: is the channel number
stem:[x_0]:: is the centroid of the Gaussian
stem:[f]:: is the width of the Gaussian
