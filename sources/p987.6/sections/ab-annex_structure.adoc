== Structure of a sample annex

=== Overview

==== Title

Every annex shall be given a title and shall be designated either
a normative or an informative annex. Notice that the numbering now
contains the annex letter. See <<eq_B-1>>:

[[eq_B-1]]
[stem]
++++
Y(x) = Y_0 exp[-(x - x_0)^2 // (2f^2) ]
++++

where

stem:[Y(x)]:: is the amplitude of the Gaussian function at channel
stem:[x]
stem:[Y_0]:: is the height of the Gaussian at the centroid channel
stem:[x]:: is the channel number
stem:[x_0]:: is the centroid of the Gaussian
stem:[f]:: is the width of the Gaussian


==== Clause and subclause organization

The material in an annex should be organized into clauses and subclauses
just like the body text. There should be at least two subclauses in
any subdivision so that if there is one second-level header, there
should be at a minimum one other one.

=== Material in annexes

Tables, figures, equations, lists, etc., in an annex are formatted
like they would be in the body of the text except that

* Tables are numbered according to the annex letter (see <<table_B-1>>).
* Figures are labeled according to the annex letter (see <<fig_B-1>>).
