== Abstract

Key discussion points covered in the draft are stated here in a few complete
sentences, using passive rather than active voice. The more specific the better since
the abstract often populates search engines and catalog databases.

== Introduction

// This introduction is not part of IEEE P987.6/D2, Draft Recommended Practice for Preparing an IEEE Standards Draft--Amendment {amendment-number}

The introduction of the frontmatter is informative. It serves to give readers
context, including background, key themes, history, etc.

NOTE: The editing instructions contained in this *amendment* define how to merge the
material contained therein into the existing base standard and its amendments to form
the comprehensive standard.

The editing instructions are shown in *_bold italic_*. Four editing instructions are
used: change, delete, insert, and replace. *_Change_* is used to make corrections in
existing text or tables. The editing instruction specifies the location of the change
and describes what is being changed by using [strike]#strikethrough# (to remove old
material) and [underline]#underscore# (to add new material). *_Delete_* removes
existing material. *_Insert_* adds new material without disturbing the existing
material. Insertions may require renumbering. If so, renumbering instructions are
given in the editing instruction. *_Replace_* is used to make changes in figures or
equations by removing the existing figure or equation and replacing it with a new
one. Editing instructions, change markings, and this NOTE will not be carried over
into future editions because the changes will be incorporated into the base standard.

means, and to open the circuit automatically on a predetermined overload of current,
without injury to itself when properly applied within its rating.

*continuous current*:: The maximum constant rms power frequency current that can be
carried continuously without causing further measurable increase in temperature rise
under prescribed conditions of test, and within the limitations of established
standards.

*loading*:: The modification of a basic antenna such as a dipole or monopole caused
by the addition of conductors or circuit elements that change the input impedance or
current distribution or both.
